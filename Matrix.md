1. What happens when you invert the identity matrix?
The identity matrix is a special kind of matrix that has 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. When you invert the identity matrix, you get the identity matrix itself. This is because the identity matrix is its own inverse.

2. What do you get when you multiply a matrix by its inverse?
When you multiply a matrix by its inverse, you get the identity matrix. This is a fundamental property of matrix inverses.

3. Is there any difference between the inverse of the transpose of a matrix, and the transpose of the inverse?
No, there is no difference. The inverse of the transpose of a matrix is the same as the transpose of the inverse of the matrix. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

[ (A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T ]

4. What happens when you change any single element of the identity matrix to a different number, and then multiply it by a tuple?
When you change any single element of the identity matrix to a different number and then multiply it by a tuple, the resulting tuple will be altered. The identity matrix has the property of leaving a tuple unchanged when multiplied by it. Changing any element breaks this property, resulting in a transformed tuple.
